## Usage

```

### Create a Card View

Use the `CardViewComponent` to create a card view:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import CardUIComponents

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        CardViewComponent(
            backgroundColor: .blue,
            symbol: "ðŸŽ´",
            fontSize: .largeTitle,
            frameSize: CGSize(width: 120, height: 180)
        )
    }
}
```

### Customization

You can customize the following properties of the `CardViewComponent`:

- `backgroundColor`: The background color of the card.
- `symbol`: The text or emoji displayed on the card.
- `fontSize`: The font size of the symbol.
- `frameSize`: The size of the card (width and height).

Example:

```swift
CardViewComponent(
    backgroundColor: .red,
    symbol: "ðŸŽƒ",
    fontSize: .title,
    frameSize: CGSize(width: 100, height: 150)
)
```
